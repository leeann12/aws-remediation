Log in to the AWS Management Console:

Go to the AWS Management Console at https://aws.amazon.com/.
Log in to your AWS account using the appropriate credentials.
Navigate to the AWS IAM Dashboard:

Once you are logged in to the AWS Management Console, go to the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Dashboard.
This can be done by clicking on the "Services" menu, and then selecting "IAM" from the list of AWS services.
Manage IAM policies:

On the IAM Dashboard, select the "Policies" option.
This will take you to the "Policies" page, where you can manage the policies associated with your AWS account.
To ensure that there are no inline policies, you should make sure that all policies are managed as AWS-managed policies or customer-managed policies, but not inline policies.
Remove inline policies:

If you find any inline policies, you should remove them.
To do this, select the inline policy and click the "Delete" button.
You should then replace the inline policy with either an AWS-managed policy or a customer-managed policy as appropriate.
Save changes:

Once you have updated the policies, click the "Save" button to apply the changes.
This will ensure that all policies are managed as either AWS-managed policies or customer-managed policies, but not inline policies.
