Log in to the AWS Management Console: Go to the AWS Management Console and log in to your AWS account.

Navigate to the IAM Dashboard: Go to the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Dashboard and select "Users."

Check for expired certificates: On the "Users" page, you can view a list of all IAM users associated with your AWS account. Check for any users with expired certificates, indicated by a red X icon.

Regenerate certificates: If you have any users with expired certificates, you should regenerate their certificates. To do this, select the user, click the "Manage User" button, and then click the "Regenerate" button next to the expired certificate.

Confirm certificate regeneration: After you have regenerated the certificates, confirm that the new certificates are working by logging in to the AWS Management Console using the affected users.
