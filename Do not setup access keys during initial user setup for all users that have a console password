Here are the steps in more detail on how to remediate the "IAM-user-console-and-API-access-at-creation" issue:

Log in to the AWS Management Console:

Go to the AWS Management Console at https://aws.amazon.com/.
Log in to your AWS account using the appropriate credentials.
Navigate to the AWS IAM Dashboard:

Once you are logged in to the AWS Management Console, go to the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Dashboard.
This can be done by clicking on the "Services" menu, and then selecting "IAM" from the list of AWS services.
Manage user permissions:

On the IAM Dashboard, select the "Users" option.
This will take you to the "Users" page, where you can manage the permissions for each IAM user in your AWS account.
To ensure that IAM users are not granted access to the AWS Management Console and/or AWS APIs at the time of their creation, you should make sure that the appropriate permissions are not granted.
To do this, select the IAM user in question and edit their permissions to remove access to the AWS Management Console and/or AWS APIs as needed.
Save changes:

Once you have updated the permissions for each IAM user, click the "Save" button to apply the changes.
This will ensure that the appropriate permissions are not granted for each IAM user.
